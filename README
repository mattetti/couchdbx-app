# CouchDBX Application Wrapper

Get http://github.com/janl/couchdbx-core/ and compile it. Copy the resulting `couchdbx-core` folder into the top level dir of this project. Launch Xcode and build the app.

## MacRuby version

You need to use the specific XCode target to copy couchdbx-core to your build folder.
If you want to run more than one instance of couchdb, add a new local_<id>.ini file to couchdbx-core/couchdb/etc/couchdb

Don't forget to also create a new folder for the db data and point to it. Here is an example of my local_test.ini file

  ; CouchDB Configuration Settings

  ; Custom settings should be made in this file. They will override settings
  ; in default.ini, but unlike changes made to default.ini, this file won't be
  ; overwritten on server upgrade.

  [couchdb]
  ;max_document_size = 4294967296 ; bytes

  [httpd]
  port = 5985
  ;bind_address = 127.0.0.1

  [log]
  ;level = debug

  [couch_httpd_auth]
  ;secret = replace this with a real secret

  [couchdb]
  ;directory used to save/load this instance db 
  database_dir = couchdb_0.10.0/var/lib/mattetti
  view_index_dir = couchdb_0.10.0/var/lib/mattetti

  [update_notification]
  ;unique notifier name=/full/path/to/exe -with "cmd line arg"

  ; To create an admin account uncomment the '[admins]' section below and add a
  ; line in the format 'username = password'. When you next start CouchDB, it
  ; will change the password to a hash (so that your passwords don't linger
  ; around in plain-text files). You can add more admin accounts with more
  ; 'username = password' lines. Don't forget to restart CouchDB after
  ; changing this.
  [admins]
  ;admin = mysecretpassword
